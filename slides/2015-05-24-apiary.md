This slide was planned to be used for the Lightning Talk of LambdaConf 2015.  
But I missed the chance.ðŸ˜ž

# Which is your favorite?

- Yesod?
- Happstack?
- Snap?
- Scotty?
- Spock?
- Servant?

# How about Apiary?

- Lightweight: Sinatra, Flask inspired.
    - The author created after getting annoyed by type-unsafety of Scotty.
- And as you might guess,
    - NO RELATION WITH "apiary.io"!

# SYNOPSIS

```haskell
[capture|/api/hello/|] $ do
  method GET . document "get hello" . action $ do
    contentType "application/json"
    bytes "{\"hello\":\"world\"}"

  method POST .
    ([key|name|] =: pMaybe pString) .
    document "say hello to +name+" .
    accept "text/plain" .
    action $ d 
      n <- param [key|name|]
      bytes "Hello, " <> n
```

# So, what's the difference?

Compared to Scotty:

- More type-safe.
    - Declare type of parameters.

    ```haskell
    ```

# So, what's the difference?

Compared to Spock:

- More resouce-oriented routing.
    - Declare URL first.
    - Then the action.

# So, what's the difference?

Compared to Servant:

- Less typing keyboard thanks to QQ-based declaration:

    ```haskell
    ```
- Doesn't need type declaration.
- Doesn't need to separate 

# Issues

- Less active development than Servant.
- Can't generate JavaScript code like Servant.
- I've never tried codes in these slides!
    - Sorry if they don't work :-p

# Conclusion

- Apiary is more robust than Scotty and Spock,
- And handier than Servant.
- `cabal install apiary`
